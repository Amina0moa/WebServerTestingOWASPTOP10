# WebServerTestingOWASPTOP10
How to Test Your Web Server Against the OWASP Top 10

The aim of this project is to evaluate the current security posture of a web server using a range of security testing tools.

**OWASP Top 10 Overview**
The OWASP Top 10 is a globally recognized standard that serves as a key awareness guide for developers and security professionals. It provides a comprehensive overview of the most critical security risks facing web applications. The list identifies and ranks the top ten vulnerabilities, which OWASP updates regularly to reflect the evolving threat landscape.
This project is structured into sections dedicated to each OWASP Top 10 category. For every category, it presents a summary of the relevant tests, tools, and techniques used, along with justifications for their selection and a discussion of the key findings.
